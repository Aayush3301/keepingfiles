java provides 3 classes to represent a sequence of characters
String ,  String Builder ,  String Buffer
String is immutable but other 2 are not... immutable means once the object is created we cannot change its content.


String Builder is not thread safe but String Buffer is.
StringBuider is more efficient

StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder("hello");
builder.append("java");
System.out.println(builder);

op :- hellojava

similarly for buffer


oops concepts in java
object , class , inheritance , polymorphism , abstraction , encapsulation

polymorphism ---  compile time polymorphism ,  runtime polymorphism

one task performed in different ways--- example speaking---  a dog braks woof ,  cat speaks meow
man at same time is father , husband , an employee

runtime :-  super class reference and sub class object--- since object is assigned at runtime not at compile time


------------

abstraction can be achieved by either abstract classes or interfaces
abstract keyword is non access modifier used for class and methods

Abstract class--- restricted class that cannot be used to create objects.. to access it, it must be inherited from another class
Abstract method --   can only be used in an abstract class and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass(inherited from)
An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods
